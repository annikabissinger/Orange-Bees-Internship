    "Since our dataset had about 270,000 observations, which was far too large, we decided to only focus on the Summer Olympics, as there have been more Summer Olympics in history and there are a wider range events contested.\n",
    "Additionally, we run Track and Field at Cornell - which is contested in the summer - and our head coach as well as some Cornell Track alumni are in this dataset. Thus, we felt we could relate more to analyzing only Summer Olympic events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily there was a season column, so we could filter out all of the data associated with a Winter Olympic. After that, the ID, Games, and Season columns were redundant so we removed them as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then realized there was a lot of data on sports that have not been contested in recent Olympics. So, we decided to only include data for sports that will be contested in the upcoming Summer 2021 Games. Polo is a summer sport but was also removed, as it contained a lot of NaN values for height and weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since team name and country differed for certain sports such as sailing and golf, we merged two tables: noc_data.csv and athlete_data.csv in order to apply country names to those who had \"NOC\" for their country names. We merged on a \"NOC\" column and used the region codes to convert NOC region codes to countries. Doing this merge also solved our issue of inconsistencies in country names across years (ex: USSR has been converted to Russia)"
